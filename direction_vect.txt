Job Listing Vectorization
This module provides functionality to convert job listing text files into vector embeddings using LlamaIndex. The vectorized output can be used for training LLM models or for similarity search applications.
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Job listing text files in a designated input directory
Required packages (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)

Directory Structure
Copyproject/
├── data/
│   ├── raw_listings/        # Input directory for text files
│   └── vectorized_listings/ # Output directory for vectors
├── requirements.txt
└── vectorize_listings.py
Usage

Place your job listing text files in the input directory (data/raw_listings/)
Run the script:

pythonCopyfrom vectorize_listings import JobListingVectorizer

vectorizer = JobListingVectorizer(
    input_dir="data/raw_listings",
    output_dir="data/vectorized_listings",
    batch_size=100  # Optional: adjust based on your memory constraints
)
vectorizer.process()
Output Format
The script generates a JSON file containing:

Document ID
Vector embeddings
Associated metadata

The vectors are generated using the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, which provides good performance for text similarity tasks.
Error Handling

The script includes comprehensive error handling and logging
Failed files are skipped with error messages logged
Process continues even if individual files or batches fail

Performance Considerations

Adjust batch_size based on available memory
Default embedding model is optimized for balance of speed and quality
Processing time depends on number and size of job listings

Integration Notes
This script is designed to be integrated into existing job listing processing pipelines. The vectorized output can be used to:

Train custom LLM models
Create embedding-based search systems
Generate job similarity metrics
Power recommendation systems
