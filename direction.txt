Now that I've provided all the necessary files and tests, let me explain how to use this project effectively:

Project Setup:

The project follows a standard Python package structure with src layout
Tests are organized in the tests directory using pytest
Configuration is managed through environment variables using .env file


Key Features:

Uses Selenium with Chrome WebDriver for reliable scraping
Implements proper error handling and logging
Includes comprehensive unit tests
CLI interface for easy usage
Configurable job search filters


Installation Steps:

bashCopy# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd linkedin-job-scraper

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your LinkedIn credentials

Running the Scraper:

bashCopy# Basic usage
linkedin-scraper --position "Software Engineer" --num-posts 10 --output-dir ./jobs

# Specifying different parameters
linkedin-scraper --position "Data Scientist" --num-posts 20 --output-dir ./data_science_jobs

Running Tests:

bashCopy# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_scraper.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run with logging
pytest --log-cli-level=INFO

Project Structure Explanation:

src/linkedin_job_scraper/:

cli.py: Command-line interface implementation
config.py: Configuration management
scraper.py: Main scraping logic
utils.py: Helper functions


tests/:

conftest.py: pytest fixtures and configuration
test_scraper.py: Scraper functionality tests
test_utils.py: Utility function tests




Error Handling:

The scraper handles common issues like:

Network timeouts
Invalid credentials
Missing elements on the page
File system errors


All errors are logged appropriately


Best Practices Implemented:

PEP 8 compliant code style
Type hints and docstrings
Proper exception handling
Comprehensive logging
Modular design
Test-driven development approach
