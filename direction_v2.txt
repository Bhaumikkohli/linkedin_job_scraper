LinkedIn has recently strengthened their anti-scraping measures, and attempting to scrape job listings without authentication is likely to be blocked quickly. Let me explain the options and provide a better solution:

Public API Approach (Recommended):
LinkedIn offers a public API through their developer platform. This is the most reliable and ethical way to access LinkedIn data.

Here's how we can modify our scraper to use the official LinkedIn API:
LinkedIn API Job ScraperClick to open code
To use this updated version, you'll need to:

Create a LinkedIn Developer account:

Go to https://www.linkedin.com/developers/
Create a new app
Get your Client ID and Client Secret
Add "http://localhost:8000/callback" to allowed redirect URLs


Update the config.py with your credentials:

pythonCopyCLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
CLIENT_SECRET = "your_client_secret"

Install additional requirements:

bashCopypip install requests oauthlib

Run the scraper:

bashCopylinkedin-scraper --position "Software Engineer" --num-posts 10 --output-dir ./jobs
Alternative Approaches:

Use Indeed's API instead:

Indeed offers a more accessible API
Better documentation and easier authentication
More lenient usage limits


Use Seek's API (for Australia specifically):

Seek is the primary job board in Australia
They offer an API for partners
More relevant for Australian job searches



Would you like me to:

Modify the scraper to use Indeed's API instead?
Add support for Seek's API?
Create a version that combines multiple job board APIs?

The choice depends on your specific needs. LinkedIn's API is more restrictive and requires business justification for access, so Indeed or Seek might be better alternatives for your use case.
